Mansons power supply remote control library and tools.

This is library is used to handle remote control of Mansons Remote programing
switching mode DC regulated power Supply of SDP Series (SDP - 2210/2405/2603).
There is also set of tools (commandline, GUI ? WIP) for basic operation with
this class of power supplies. This library and most of tools are made to be
multiplatform and portable as much as posible (mainly Linux and Windows is 
tested, but other *NIX like operting systems should work too).

This stuff is licensed uder conditions defined in GPLv2 (see LICENSE file for 
details). Under reasonable conditions (defined by my) I can keep rights to 
change license to BSD (all contributing developers will be explicitly asked
for confirmation of this before anny code will be accepted).
